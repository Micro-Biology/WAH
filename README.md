## These questions are WIP

### Directed development questions: (there are papers on the G drive)

How does PEG precipitation work? And why is sewage a challenging matrix?

How does nucleic acid purification/concentration work? And why do we do it?

How does qPCR work? Why do we use RNA standards for detection of RNA?

What controls do we have throughout the entire process? Think about what each of these controls are for, and how they may be used to troubleshoot any issues, such as contamination.
